          During college, I built software and web applications using C++, Java, and PHP, gaining hands-on experience in programming. After graduating in 2019, I explored a career in the BPO industry, where I refined my communication and problem-solving skills. However, my passion for technology led me back to coding, and I dedicated myself to mastering JavaScript, modern frameworks, and full-stack development.

          Now, Iâ€™m eager to apply my technical skills and collaborate with a team to build impactful solutions. I thrive in dynamic environments, embrace new challenges, and continuously seek growth as a developer.
